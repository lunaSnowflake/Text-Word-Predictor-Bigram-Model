# Text-Word-Predictor-Bigram-Model

### Introduction:
In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), predictive text generation is a fundamental task with numerous applications, such as autocomplete, chatbots, and machine translation. The "Attention Is All You Need" paper introduced the revolutionary Transformer architecture, which has since become a cornerstone in modern NLP. This project aims to leverage the Transformer's attention mechanisms to build a Bigram language model that predicts the next word in a sentence given the previous words.

### 🔍 Project Overview:
In the fast-paced world of predictive text generation, I've embarked on a journey to harness the power of the Transformer architecture, famously introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf">📄</a> My goal? To create a cutting-edge bigram language model that predicts the next word in a sentence based on the two preceding words.


### 📊 Project Steps:
• Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned diverse text data to fuel the model's training. <br/>
• Implementing the Transformer Architecture: Brought the core of the Transformer to life, featuring self-attention and feedforward neural networks. <br/>
• Creating the Bigram Language Model: Tailored the Transformer to handle bigram predictions, accommodating two preceding words. <br/>
• Training the Model: Trained the model, optimized with Adam, and kept a close eye on validation performance. <br/>
• Evaluation: Measured the model's success using metrics like perplexity and accuracy, comparing it against traditional n-grams. <br/>
• Fine-tuning and Optimization: Explored the hyperparameter landscape to unlock the model's full potential. <br/>
• Inference and Prediction: Transformed the model into a real-time next-word predictor, leveraging its learned contextual insights. <br/>

### 🌟 Impact and Future:
This project showcases the dynamic synergy between the Transformer architecture and Bigram-based language modeling. By expanding contextual understanding, we're stepping up the game in various NLP applications, from autocomplete to chatbots and beyond.
