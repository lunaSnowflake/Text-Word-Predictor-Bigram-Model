# Text-Word-Predictor-Bigram-Model

Introduction:
In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), predictive text generation is a fundamental task with numerous applications, such as autocomplete, chatbots, and machine translation. The "Attention Is All You Need" paper introduced the revolutionary Transformer architecture, which has since become a cornerstone in modern NLP. This project aims to leverage the Transformer's attention mechanisms to build a Bigram language model that predicts the next word in a sentence given the previous words.

üîç Project Overview:
In the fast-paced world of predictive text generation, I've embarked on a journey to harness the power of the Transformer architecture, famously introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. üìÑ My goal? To create a cutting-edge bigram language model that predicts the next word in a sentence based on the two preceding words.

üìä Project Steps:
‚Ä¢ Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned diverse text data to fuel the model's training.
‚Ä¢ Implementing the Transformer Architecture: Brought the core of the Transformer to life, featuring self-attention and feedforward neural networks.
‚Ä¢ Creating the Bigram Language Model: Tailored the Transformer to handle bigram predictions, accommodating two preceding words.
‚Ä¢ Training the Model: Trained the model, optimized with Adam, and kept a close eye on validation performance.
‚Ä¢ Evaluation: Measured the model's success using metrics like perplexity and accuracy, comparing it against traditional n-grams.
‚Ä¢ Fine-tuning and Optimization: Explored the hyperparameter landscape to unlock the model's full potential.
‚Ä¢ Inference and Prediction: Transformed the model into a real-time next-word predictor, leveraging its learned contextual insights.

üåü Impact and Future:
This project showcases the dynamic synergy between the Transformer architecture and Bigram-based language modeling. By expanding contextual understanding, we're stepping up the game in various NLP applications, from autocomplete to chatbots and beyond.
